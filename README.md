# Band App

## Installation

You'll need the version of python in the .python-version file. I suggest using pyenv and virtualenv to manage your executable and libraries:

1. Install pyenv for your system (depending on your method, this may come bundled with virtualenv)
2. `pyenv install 3.10.1`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
